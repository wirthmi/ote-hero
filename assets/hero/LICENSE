Terms of use

These images are public domain (PD), and that means they can be used and edited
for whatever purpose you wish, personal or commercial. (You can even apply for
Trademark status in the US starting with a PD image.) No attribution or linking
is required. (although a link would be nice...)

I only make one request:

I don't want folks to copy the collection to repost online (basically mirroring
my site.) I spend a lot of time finding, researching copyright status and
editing/retouching as well as donating hundreds of my own images, so I believe
that should warrant some consideration. We can be courteous to each other, even
online -- why not?

Allowed Usage Summary:

    You CAN modify any of the images in any way you wish.
    You CAN use the images in your own work, both personal and commercial.
    You CAN use the images, altered or not, for any printed work.
    You CAN use one or several of the images on websites
    (for school, personal or even commercial use... see below.)
    You SHOULD NOT redistribute (as a collection) a lot of the images online.

WPClipart: is here to maintain and grow an online collection of artwork for
schoolkids and others that is free of copyright concerns as well as safe from
inappropriate images. To ensure these qualities, no direct user-uploaded images
are allowed. All artwork is collected/edited or created for use by me with the
GIMP, Inkscape and some GIMP extras on Absolute Linux. Please email me if you
have any questions or concerns. And thanks for stopping by :-)
